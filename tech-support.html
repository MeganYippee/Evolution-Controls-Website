                  Most relays used in HVAC machines allow low voltage 24Vac
                  circuits to control high voltage, high current devices like
                  motors and electric heating elements. These relays need
                  special attention so they do not interfere with electronic
                  devices inside or near the HVAC machine.

               <br />
               <br />
               <strong>A.</strong> Yes, if you are a bona fide equipment
               manufacturer. Contractors, end users and others needing Evolution
               Controls’ Products should contact Gexpro at +1 (513) 326-2134 in
               the US or BSR at +1(905) 670-3229 in Canada.

               <strong>Q.</strong> Can I use Evolution’s EC Motor controls on
               any EC Motor?
               <br />
               <br />
               <strong>A.</strong> No, the motor has to be programmed for Vspd
               mode. Most EC Motors are custom programmed by the equipment
               manufacturer. Many, especially in residential applications are
               not programmed for Vspd mode. Please contact Evolution Controls
               Inc. at 858-748-7359 to find out if the motor you are interested
               in will work with our controls.

               <strong>Q.</strong> Can I Vspd control an RB X13 motor?
               <br />
               <br />
               <strong>A.</strong> Maybe. These motors are Vspd enabled for
               in-house testing by equipment manufacturers, and for a very few
               commercial applications. Most X13s in production equipment will
               not be Vspd enabled. Be careful not to develop a Vspd application
               for an X13, just to find out you will not be allowed to use it in
               production!
               <br />
               <br />
               Our EVO™/ECM-X13 controller allows a 0- +10V signal to step
               control a Regal Beloit X13 or Endura Pro ECM motor.

               <strong>Q.</strong> What are the Evolution Controls standard
               control cable pinouts?
               <br />
               <br />
               <strong>A.</strong> The standard pinout is 4 pins on an Amp MTA
               100 header. Notice the solder pad (back of PC board) for the pins
               have three round pads and one square pad. The square pad is pin
               1.
               <br />
               <br />Go = Pin 1, Status = Pin 2, Common = Pin 3, and Vspd =
               Pin4. <br />Go = White, Status = Black, Common = Green, and Vspd
               = Red. <br />Go isused by some motors to signal the motor to run.
               <br />
               <br />Status is an output from the motor that lights the red lamp
               on the EVO control and provides tachometer pulses to those EVO
               products having RPM feedback. Make sure the status output is
               programmed RPM only for EVO products having RPM feedback. Common
               is the common for the other three pins. Vspd is a PWM signal with
               12.5ms duration and 22Vdc peak voltage for most EVO/ECM controls.
               Some special variations exist.

               <strong>Q.</strong> Why does my EVO/ECM-VCU display have strange
               numbers where there should be an RPM reading?
               <br />
               <br />
               <strong>A.</strong> This problem is most often because the status
               output (Flag 7 for RB’s ECM 2.3 motor) is not programmed to RPM
               only. However, if your VCU reads 8888, this will occur the first
               three times the control is powered up as a factory test for the
               LED's and will disappear after a few seconds. After the third
               power-up, this will not occur again.
